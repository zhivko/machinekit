# Export GPIO pins:
# One pin needs to be exported to enable the low-level clocks for the GPIO
# modules (there is probably a better way to do this)
# 
# Any GPIO pins driven by the PRU need to have their direction set properly
# here.  The PRU does not do any setup of the GPIO, it just yanks on the
# pins and assumes you have the output enables configured already
# 
# Direct PRU inputs and outputs do not need to be configured here, the pin
# mux setup (which is handled by the device tree overlay) should be all
# the setup needed.
# 
# Any GPIO pins driven by the hal_bb_gpio driver do not need to be
# configured here.  The hal_bb_gpio module handles setting the output
# enable bits properly.  These pins _can_ however be set here without
# causing problems.  You may wish to do this for documentation or to make
# sure the pin starts with a known value as soon as possible.
