== NAME
counter - counts input pulses (**DEPRECATED**)

== SYNOPSIS
**loadrt counter [num_chan=__N__]**

== DESCRIPTION
**counter** is a deprecated HAL component and will be removed in a future
release.  Use the **encoder** component with encoder.X.counter-mode set to
TRUE.

**counter** is a HAL component that provides software-
based counting that is useful for spindle position sensing and
maybe other things.  Instead of using a real encoder that outputs
quadrature, some lathes have a sensor that generates a simple pulse
stream as the spindle turns and an index pulse once per revolution.
This component simply counts up when a "count" pulse (phase-A)
is received, and if reset is enabled, resets when the "index"
(phase-Z) pulse is received.

This is of course only useful for a unidirectional spindle, as it
is not possible to sense the direction of rotation.

**counter** conforms to the "canonical encoder" interface described
in the HAL manual.

== FUNCTIONS
**counter.capture-position** (uses floating-point)

[indent=4]
====
Updates the counts, position and velocity outputs based on internal counters.
====

**counter.update-counters**

[indent=4]
====
Samples the phase-A and phase-Z inputs and updates internal counters.
====

== PINS
**counter.**__N__**.phase-A** bit in

[indent=4]
====
The primary input signal.  The internal counter is incremented on each
rising edge.
====

**counter.**__N__**.phase-Z** bit in

[indent=4]
====
The index input signal.  When the **index-enable** pin is TRUE and a rising
edge on **phase-Z** is seen, **index-enable** is set to FALSE and the
internal counter is reset to zero.
====

**counter.**__N__**.index-enable** bit io

**counter.**__N__**.reset** bit io

**counter.**__N__**.counts** signed out

**counter.**__N__**.position** float out

**counter.**__N__**.velocity** float out

[indent=4]
====
These pins function according to the canonical digital encoder interface.
====

**counter.**__N__**.position-scale** float rw

[indent=4]
====
This parameter functions according to the canonical digital encoder interface.
====

**counter.**__N__**.rawcounts** signed ro

[indent=4]
====
The internal counts value, updated from **update-counters** and reflected
in the output pins at the next call to **capture-position**.
