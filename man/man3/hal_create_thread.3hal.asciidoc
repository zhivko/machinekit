== NAME

hal_create_thread -- Create a HAL thread



== SYNTAX
int hal_create_thread(const char *__name__, unsigned long
__period__, int __uses_fp__, int __cpu_id__)

int hal_thread_delete(const char *__name__)



== ARGUMENTS
.IP __name__
The name of the thread

.IP __period__
The interval, in nanoseconds, between iterations of the thread

.IP __uses_fp__
Must be nonzero if a function which uses floating-point will be attached
to this thread.

.IP __cpu_id__
Make the RTAPI layer bind this thread to a particular CPU core.



== DESCRIPTION
**hal_create_thread** establishes a realtime thread that will
execute one or more HAL functions periodically.

All thread periods are rounded to integer multiples of the hardware timer
period, and the timer period is based on the first thread created.  Threads
must be created in order, from the fastest to the slowest.  HAL assigns
decreasing priorities to threads that are created later, so creating them
from fastest to slowest results in rate monotonic priority scheduling.

**hal_delete_thread** deletes a previously created thread.



== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
Call only from realtime init code, not from user space or realtime code.



== RETURN VALUE
Returns a HAL status code.
