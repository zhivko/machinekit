== NAME

rtapi_task_new -- create a realtime task



== SYNTAX
int rtapi_task_new(void (*__taskcode__)(void*), void *__arg__,
	int __prio__, unsigned long __stacksize__, int
	__uses_fp__, char **__name__, int __cpu_id__)
int rtapi_task_delete(int __task_id__)


== ARGUMENTS
.IP __taskcode__
A pointer to the function to be called when the task is started
.IP __arg__
An argument to be passed to the __taskcode__ function when the task is
started
.IP __prio__
A task priority value returned by **rtapi_prio_xxxx**
.IP __uses_fp__
A flag that tells the OS whether the task uses floating point or not.
.IP __task_id__
A task ID returned by a previous call to **rtapi_task_new**
.IP __name__
The name argument is used to identify the thread by name at the
operating system level. Corresponds to the HAL name of the thread.
.IP __cpu_id__
Bind this thread to a particular CPU core.



== DESCRIPTION
**rtapi_task_new** creates but does not start a realtime task.  The task is
created in the "paused" state.  To start it, call either **rtapi_task_start**
for periodic tasks, or **rtapi_task_resume** for free-running tasks.



== REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
Call only from within init/cleanup code, not from realtime tasks.



== RETURN VALUE
On success, returns a positive integer task ID.  This ID is used
for all subsequent calls that need to act on the task.  On failure,
returns an RTAPI status code.
