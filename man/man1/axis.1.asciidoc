== NAME
axis -- AXIS LinuxCNC Graphical User Interface


== SYNOPSIS
axis
__-ini__ __INIFILE__


== DESCRIPTION
**axis** is one of the Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for LinuxCNC 
It gets run by the runscript usually.


== OPTIONS

**INIFILE**
The ini file is the main piece of an LinuxCNC configuration. It is not the
entire configuration; there are various other files that go with it
(NML files, HAL files, TBL files, VAR files). It is, however, the most
important one, because it is the file that holds the configuration
together. It can adjust a lot of parameters itself, but it also tells
**LinuxCNC** which other files to load and use.



== SEE ALSO
**LinuxCNC(1)**

Much more information about LinuxCNC and HAL is available in the LinuxCNC
and HAL User Manuals, found at /usr/share/doc/LinuxCNC/.
