This tests the 'start' pin on downward motion.  It replicates the
motion in ../limit-accel-and-max but in the opposite direction.  Since
it sets the same max accel and velocity, and begins slowing down when
input hits -80, with a 'scale' comp to fix velocity, it can reuse the
same 'expected' output.
