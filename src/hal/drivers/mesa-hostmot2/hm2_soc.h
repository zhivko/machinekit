// the pci dev would corrospond to the uio dev in the soc system.
// the only unique thing the uio device provides is easy access to the hardware memory
// through /dev/uio0 device.
// A design practice this is is dscuraged for future designs by Denx who provides u-boot
// among others.   
// Therefore there is a solid reason for creating an pci --> uio struct containing whats left from there.
// And adding a dts_device_id for all devices that can benefit from utilising device-tree info.
// To have a forward way towards partial fpga reconfiguration data structures relating to device tree overlays.
// could come in handy. Once the soc / embedded systems migrate to 4.x+ kernels.
