/** The following data structures are used by the HAL but are not part
    of the HAL API and should not be visible to code that uses the HAL.
*/

/** At runtime, the HAL consists of a pile of interconnected data
    structures in a block of shared memory.  There are linked lists
    of components, pins, signals, parameters, functions, and threads.
    Most of the lists are sorted by name, and each of these lists is
    cross linked to the others.  All pins, parameters, functions, and
    threads are linked to the component that created them.  In addition,
    pins are linked to signals, and functions are linked to threads.
    On top of that, when items are deleted, they are stored in (you
    guessed it) linked lists for possible reuse later.

    As a result, the pointer manipulation needed to add or remove
    an item from the HAL gets a little complex and hard to follow.
    Sorry about that...  tread carefully, especially in the
    free_xxx_struct functions.  And mind your mutexes.

    And just to make it more fun: shared memory is mapped differently
    for each process and for the kernel, so you can't just pass pointers
    to shared memory objects from one process to another.  So we use
    integer offsets from the start of shared memory instead of pointers.
    In addition to adding overhead, this makes the code even harder to
    read.  Very annoying!  Like near/far pointers in the old days!
    In areas where speed is critical, we sometimes use both offsets
    (for general access) and pointers (for fast access by the owning
    component only).  The macros below are an attempt to neaten things
    up a little.

    functions, then threads are used to run the functions in the

// and other data permitting for better introspection. Those functs

//
// (3) functs can now also be called via userland action, for instance
// by halcmd 'call compname funcname <optional args>'; that is - not by
// a thread at all. These functs evidently have a signature which
// is not compatible with threading (more like 'main(argc, argv)',

/** The 'shmalloc_xx()' functions allocate blocks of shared memory.
    Each function allocates a block that is 'size' bytes long.
    If 'size' is 3 or more, the block is aligned on a 4 byte
    boundary.  If 'size' is 2, it is aligned on a 2 byte boundary,
    and if 'size' is 1, it is unaligned.
    These functions do not test a mutex - they are called from
    within the hal library by code that already has the mutex.
    (The public function 'hal_malloc()' is a wrapper that gets the
    mutex and then calls 'shmalloc_up()'.)
    The only difference between the two functions is the location
    of the allocated memory.  'shmalloc_up()' allocates from the
    base of shared memory and works upward, while 'shmalloc_dn()'
    starts at the top and works down.
    This is done to improve realtime performance.  'shmalloc_up()'
    is used to allocate data that will be accessed by realtime
    code, while 'shmalloc_dn()' is used to allocate the much
    larger structures that are accessed only occaisionally during
    init.  This groups all the realtime data together, inproving
    cache performance.
